# geocoreg
A library to simplify the process of co-registering geospatial data.
Althought some great libraries provide co-registration functionalities, such as scikit-image and konia, they don't directly support geospatial data. This library aims to provide a simple and easy-to-use interface to co-register geospatial data in a pythonic way. The library design was created to allow the user to select different co-registration methods available in other libraries. 

## Installation
To install the package, run the command below
```
pip install git+https://github.com/lbferreira/geocoreg
```
